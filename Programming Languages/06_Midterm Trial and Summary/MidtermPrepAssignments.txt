### Midterm Assignment 1: Basic Java Program (15 Points)

**Objective**: Create a simple Java program, handle inputs, and use basic conditionals.

**Task**:
Write a Java program that calculates and categorizes a student’s score in a test.

1. **Input**:
    - Accept three scores from the user, each between 0 and 100.

2. **Process**:
    - Calculate the average score.
    - Categorize performance based on the average score:
        - `Excellent` for average ≥ 85
        - `Good` for 70 ≤ average < 85
        - `Average` for 50 ≤ average < 70
        - `Poor` for average < 50

3. **Output**:
    - Display the calculated average and the performance category.

### **Assignment 1 Output Sample**

Suppose the user inputs three scores: 78, 82, and 90.

**Output**:
```plaintext
Enter score for Test 1: 78
Enter score for Test 2: 82
Enter score for Test 3: 90

Average Score: 83.33
Performance: Good
```

If the user inputs 50, 60, and 40:

**Output**:
```plaintext
Enter score for Test 1: 50
Enter score for Test 2: 60
Enter score for Test 3: 40

Average Score: 50.0
Performance: Average
```

### Midterm Assignment 2: Object-Oriented Program with Array of Objects (25 Points)

This assignment has two parts, focusing on creating classes, using arrays of objects, and basic object interaction.

#### Part (a) – Book Class and Library Class (10 Points)

1. Create a `Book` class with attributes:
    - `title` (String)
    - `author` (String)
    - `price` (double)

2. In a `Library` class, add:
    - A `Book[] books` array to store multiple book instances.
    - `addBook(Book book)`: Method to add a book to the array.
    - `displayAllBooks()`: Method to display all books in the library.

3. **Demonstration**:
    - Prompt the user to enter details for three books.
    - Display all entered book details.

#### Part (b) – Searching and Sorting (15 Points)

1. **Search Method**:
    - Add `findBooksByAuthor(String author)` to `Library` to search and print books by a specific author.

2. **Sorting Method**:
    - `sortBooksByPrice()`: Sorts books by price in ascending order.
    - Display the list before and after sorting.

3. **Example Output**:
    - Allow the user to enter an author’s name to search for matching books.
    - Display books sorted by price before and after calling `sortBooksByPrice()`.

### **Assignment 2 Output Sample**

This assignment has two parts, (a) and (b), and includes `Book` and `Library` classes with methods to display all books, search by author, and sort by price.

---

#### **Assignment 2 - Part (a) Output**

Suppose the user enters details for three books as follows:

1. **Book 1**:
    - Title: Java Programming Basics
    - Author: Alice Brown
    - Price: 29.99

2. **Book 2**:
    - Title: Advanced Java
    - Author: John Smith
    - Price: 39.99

3. **Book 3**:
    - Title: Data Structures in Java
    - Author: Alice Brown
    - Price: 19.99

After calling `displayAllBooks()`:

**Output**:
```plaintext
Book 1:
Title: Java Programming Basics
Author: Alice Brown
Price: 29.99

Book 2:
Title: Advanced Java
Author: John Smith
Price: 39.99

Book 3:
Title: Data Structures in Java
Author: Alice Brown
Price: 19.99
```

---

#### **Assignment 2 - Part (b) Output**

**Search by Author**:
If the user searches for books by "Alice Brown," the output will be:

```plaintext
Enter the author to search for: Alice Brown

Books by Alice Brown:
Title: Java Programming Basics
Price: 29.99

Title: Data Structures in Java
Price: 19.99
```

**Sorting by Price**:
Before sorting:
```plaintext
Books before sorting by price:
Title: Java Programming Basics
Price: 29.99

Title: Advanced Java
Price: 39.99

Title: Data Structures in Java
Price: 19.99
```

After calling `sortBooksByPrice()`, the sorted list will be:

```plaintext
Books after sorting by price:
Title: Data Structures in Java
Price: 19.99

Title: Java Programming Basics
Price: 29.99

Title: Advanced Java
Price: 39.99
```

### Midterm Assignment 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism (20 Points)

**Objective**: To assess understanding of inheritance, polymorphism, and runtime type-checking by creating and managing a collection of media items.

#### Task

1. **Create a Base Class**: `Media`
    - **Attributes**:
        - `title` (String)
        - `creator` (String) – represents the creator (e.g., author or director)
    - **Method**:
        - `displayInfo()`: Prints the title and creator of the media.

2. **Create Derived Classes**:
    - **Book** extends `Media`:
        - **Additional Attribute**: `numPages` (int)
        - **Unique Method**: `readSample()`: Prints a message indicating that the sample pages are available to read.
        - **Override** `displayInfo()` to include the number of pages.

    - **Movie** extends `Media`:
        - **Additional Attribute**: `duration` (double) representing duration in minutes.
        - **Unique Method**: `watchTrailer()`: Prints a message indicating that a trailer is available to watch.
        - **Override** `displayInfo()` to include the duration.

3. **Polymorphic Display and Type-Specific Methods**:
    - In the `Library` class, add a `displayAllMedia()` method that accepts an array of `Media` objects and displays each item’s info.
    - **Type-Checking**:
        - As you traverse the `Media[]` array, check each object’s type.
        - If the object is a `Book`, call its `readSample()` method.
        - If the object is a `Movie`, call its `watchTrailer()` method.

4. **Example Usage**:
    - Create instances of `Book` and `Movie`, store them in a `Media[]` array, and use `displayAllMedia()` to print each media’s details.
    - Ensure `displayAllMedia()` also calls `readSample()` for `Book` objects and `watchTrailer()` for `Movie` objects as it traverses the array.

**Expected Output** (Example):

```plaintext
Title: Java Essentials
Creator: Alice Johnson
Pages: 320
Sample: Sample pages are available to read.

Title: Learning AI
Creator: Bob Smith
Duration: 120 minutes
Trailer: Watch the trailer available.

Title: Effective Programming
Creator: Carol White
Pages: 450
Sample: Sample pages are available to read.
```
