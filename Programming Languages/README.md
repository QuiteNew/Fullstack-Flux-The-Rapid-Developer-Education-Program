# Programming Languages


### Subject Outline
This is a course designed to teach the main concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using the Java programming language. The students will learn through concrete programming problems, the main paradigms of object-oriented programming such as objects, abstraction, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. The student, after completing this course, will be able to:

* Become familiar with the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming.
* Implement encapsulation.
* Increase the modularity of software by making it extensible.
* Implement abstract data types through the use of classes.\
* Use constructor functions to initialize objects.
* Perform method overloading.
* Use inheritance to build a class hierarchy.
* Apply polymorphism and abstract classes.


### Learning Objectives

* Use complete programming constructs to write a software application.
* Demonstrate understanding of abstraction, specification, refinement and implementation.
* Use OOP concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism.
* Acquire hands-on experience of Java “flavored” OOP.
* Develop a problem solving approach to meet the software programming needs of people in general with critical thinking and teamwork.
